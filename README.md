# Sort Visualizer

Visualization of standard sorting algorithms.

You can choose which algorithm to visualize (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Radix Sort), the type of array (random order, decreasing order, subsequential order), and the number of elements (50, 100, 200, 500).

Code is written in C++, with the help of Qt for GUI.
